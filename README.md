# SURFLEX python code for simulating surface radiation and energy flux exchanges



This python code estimates daytime surface radiation and energy fluxes over grass using a land surface scheme
that incorporates limited routine weather data. The code also evaluate the sensitivity of the scheme
to different parameterizations of surface resistance for contrasting soil moisture regimes.



The scheme is adapted from de Rooy and Holtslag (1999), and the tested surface resistance
models are based on FAO method (Allen et al., 1998) and modified Jarvis approach (Jarvis, 1976), implemented by
Beljaars and Bosveld (1997). 



The python code is based on the study carried out over temperate grassland with contrasting soil moisture zones (wet and free-daining)
in Ireland (Ishola et al., 2020).
